# Git Overlap

A multi-provider tool that **identifies file overlaps** and **potential conflicts** by analyzing **which open Pull/Merge Requests are modifying the same files you are currently editing**.

## 📖 Usage

### 📊 Example
```bash
$ git overlap -f src/main.py,README.md,src/foo.py

Debug: Parsed repository full name from REMOTE_URL: https://github.com/marcoganassin96/git-overlap
🔑 Searching GitHub for PRs modifying 2 file(s) via gh CLI...
Debug: Analyzing 15 open PR(s) in the repository...

Processing PR 15 of 15: #132 (docs/readme)...

--- Results ---
File: **src/main.py** is modified in PRs:
PR #121: feature/user-authentication
PR #123: bugfix/login-validation

File: **README.md** is modified in PRs:
PR #132: docs/readme
```

⚠️ **Note**: To use this tool, you need to install it following the [Setup Instructions](#setup) below.

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Analyze uncommitted files in the local repository (default)
git overlap
# or, explicitly
git overlap --local

# Analyze files changed in the current branch compared to its base branch
git overlap --branch
```

### Custom File Analysis
```bash
# Analyze a single file
git overlap --file src/main.py

# Analyze multiple files
git overlap --file src/main.py --file README.md

# Analyze comma-separated files
git overlap --file "src/main.py,README.md,package.json"
```

### Advanced Usage
```bash
# Analyze specific files in a custom remote repository using API method and limit to 50 PRs
git overlap -f "README.md,sparkling_water/ai_engine/ai.py" -u "https://github.com/marcoganassin96/git-overlap-tester-github.git" -m api -l 50
```

### Command Line Options

| Option | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `--local` | Analyze uncommitted files in the local repository (optional, mutually exclusive with --branch and --file) | `git overlap --local` |
| `--branch` | Analyze files changed in the current branch compared to its base branch (optional, mutually exclusive with --local and --file) | `git overlap --branch` |
| `[-f\|--file] <path>` | File path to analyze (optional, mutually exclusive with --local and --branch). Can be specified multiple times or as a comma-separated list. | `--file src/main.py --file README.md` or `--file "src/main.py,README.md"` |
| `[-u\|--url] <url>` | Git remote URL (optional, auto-detected if not provided) | `--url https://github.com/user/repo.git` |
| `[-m\|--method] <gh\|api>` | Method to use for querying provider: `gh` (GitHub CLI) or `api` (REST via curl). If omitted the script auto-detects the best available method. | `--method api` |
| `[-l\|--limit] <number>` | Maximum number of open PRs to analyze (defaults to 200). Useful to cap work when repositories have many open PRs. | `--limit 100` |

If none of `--local`, `--branch`, or `--file` is provided, `--local` is assumed by default.

### Environment Variables
| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | GitHub Personal Access Token for API authentication (required if using API method) | `export GITHUB_TOKEN='your_token_here'` |
| `BITBUCKET_TOKEN` | Bitbucket Token for API authentication (required for Bitbucket API method) | `export BITBUCKET_TOKEN='your_token_here'` |
| `DEBUG` | Enable logging debug messages when set to `1` | `export DEBUG=1` |


## 🚀 Features

- **Multi-Provider Support**: Currently works with GitHub and Bitbucket. GitLab support is planned.
- **Automatic Provider Detection**: Automatically detects the Git hosting provider from remote URLs
- **Flexible Input**: Support for overlap detection with multiple files and custom remote repo. Files you're working on (uncommited files) are used by default.
- **Multiple Access Methods**: Uses CLI tools (like `gh` for GitHub) when available for better performance, otherwise falls back to REST API.
- **Comprehensive Output**: Provides detailed output of overlapping files and associated PRs/MRs.


## 🎯 Use Cases

### 1. Team Coordination
Help teams identify potential conflicts in their work in early stages, so they can coordinate planning of their actual work!

### 2. Avoid Redundant Work
Find out if someone else is already working on the same files/features you're thinking to add/modify, before actually starting the work!

### 3. Pre-Merge Conflict Detection
Check for potential conflicts before creating a PR


## 📋 Supported Providers

| Provider | CLI Tool | API Method | Authentication | Working Status |
|----------|----------|------------|----------------|----------------|
| **GitHub** | `gh` (recommended) | REST API | `GITHUB_TOKEN` | ✅ Fully Supported |
| **Bitbucket** | N/A | REST API | `BITBUCKET_TOKEN` | ✅ Added (API)
| **GitLab** | `glab` (recommended) | REST API | `GITLAB_TOKEN` | 🛠 Work in Progress |

## SETUP
1. Download the [Last 'git-overlap-0.0.1.zip' release](https://github.com/marcoganassin96/git-overlap/releases/latest)
2. Unzip the contents to a directory of your choice
3. Run the `setup.sh` script to install the tool and set up necessary environment variables
   ```bash
   cd path/to/unzipped/directory
   bash setup.sh
   ```
4. Restart your terminal or source your shell configuration file to apply changes
   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc  # or source ~/.zshrc for Zsh users
   ```
5. Verify installation by running:
   ```bash
   git-overlap -h
   ```
   Alternatively, you can jump straight into a project. **Open a Git Bash terminal in your project directory** and run:
   ```bash
   git overlap
   ```
6. Follow the Authentication Setup section below to configure access tokens for your Git providers (not needed if using CLI tools like `gh`)


## 🚀 Work in progress
- Implementation for GitLab provider
- Publish as installable package (e.g., via homebrew, winget, ...)

## 🛠 Installation & Dependencies

### Required Dependencies
- `jq` - JSON processor (required for all providers)
- `curl` - HTTP client (required for API methods)

### Optional CLI Tools (Recommended)
- `gh` - GitHub CLI (for better GitHub performance)
- `glab` - GitLab CLI (for better GitLab performance)

### Install Dependencies

**Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):**
```bash
sudo apt install jq curl
# Optional: Install CLI tools
sudo apt install gh
curl -s https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cli/-/releases/permalink/latest/downloads/glab_linux_amd64.deb -o glab.deb && sudo dpkg -i glab.deb
```

**macOS (Homebrew):**
```bash
brew install jq curl gh glab
```

**Windows:**
```bash
winget install jqlang.jq
winget install GitHub.cli
winget install GitLab.GitLabCLI
```

## 🔐 Authentication Setup

### GitHub
```bash
# Method 1: Using GitHub CLI (recommended)
gh auth login

# Method 2: Using Personal Access Token
export GITHUB_TOKEN='your_github_token_here'
```

### Bitbucket
```bash
export BITBUCKET_TOKEN='your_bitbucket_token_here'
```

### GitLab
```bash
# Method 1: Using GitLab CLI (recommended)
glab auth login

# Method 2: Using Personal Access Token
export GITLAB_TOKEN='your_gitlab_token_here'
```

## Unit Tests
To run unit tests, execute the following command from the project root:
```bash
./tests/run_tests.sh
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Authentication Errors:**
- Ensure tokens are set correctly in environment variables
- Verify token permissions (repo access for GitHub, read_api for GitLab)
- For Bitbucket, ensure both username and app password are set

**Missing Dependencies:**
- Install `jq` and `curl` as they are required for all providers
- Install CLI tools (`gh`, `glab`) for better performance

**API Rate Limits:**
- GitHub: 5,000 requests per hour with token
- Bitbucket: 1,000 requests per hour
- GitLab: 2,000 requests per minute
